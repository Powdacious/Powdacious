### Hi there 👋

My name is Jamie Power, thank you for checking out my GitHub info.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I had dreadlocks in my teen years, for a white Irish kid that was uncommon, probably still is.
- 🐣 Bonus fun fact: when I cut off the dreadlocks, various friends requested a dreadlock as momentos, last I heard some people have theirs to this very day

💡 My influences: people who have inspired me are a bit quirky, some are even characters;\
  **Clint Eastwood** - to me, represents authenticity, what you see is what you get\
  **Sylvester Stallone** - represents championing hope stories\
  **Detective Columbo** - played by Peter Falk, represents humility\
  *  3x things these influences have in common: They're old school, they demonstrate hard work ethic, they smoke cigars 💡
