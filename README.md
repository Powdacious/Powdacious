### Hi there 👋

My name is Jamie Power, thank you for checking out my GitHub info.

- 📍 Based in: Ireland (Éire)☘️ Specifically County Wexford

- 🧑‍💻 I’m currently working as a Product Owner in Fintech and am studying Digital Product Management at UCD Professional Academy
- 💬 Ask me about Jesus Christ, what the gospel is, tell me what you think, or just ask for prayer requests 🙏
- 📫 How to reach me: connect and DM me in LinkedIn; [linkedin.com/in/powerjamie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/powerjamie/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I had dreadlocks in my teen years, for a white Irish kid that was uncommon, probably still is.

💡 My influences: people who have inspired me are a bit quirky, some are even characters;\
  **Clint Eastwood** - to me, represents authenticity, what you see is what you get\
  **Sylvester Stallone** - represents championing hope stories\
  **Detective Columbo** - played by Peter Falk, represents humility\
  *  3x things these influences have in common: They're old school, they demonstrate hard work ethic, they smoke cigars 💡
